The Lucid Mud Engine is an attempt to build a feature rich "modern" take on a MUD development toolkit. The development
of Lucid follows (X) tenants throughout it's design. These are:

### Ease of Development
Lucid attempts to follow the Ruby programming languages "principle of least surprise". Development with the LME should 
be intuitive, following well established design patterns in the Typescript, JavaScript, and the MUD worlds. Powerful 
tools are provided to developers and admins to build virtual worlds quickly and easily.

### Convention over Configuration
The LME is designed to allow MUD developers to get down to the business of doing exactly that. Developing MUDs. To that
end, the LME attempts to abstract away the gritting details of network and state management allowing developers and 
admins to focus on running their virtual worlds.

### Extensibility
While the LME favors convention over configuration, it also allows for extreme alteration and flexibility. The LME is 
flexible enough to customize almost every aspect of the gameplay.

### Don't Re-invent the Wheel
The LME makes heavy use of existing design patterns and libraries rather than reinventing the wheel. If an existing 
library or convention exists to accomplish a specific task, that will be used instead of trying to create new ones.
